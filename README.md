Debug Bot using Q-Learning:
This project is a Reinforcement Learning-based Debug Bot that helps identify and solve programming errors. It uses Q-learning to associate error messages with their appropriate solutions and learns from a dataset of common errors and fixes.
Integrated educational website suggestions based on searched topics to support self-learning.
Designed it to avoid sharing full code solutions, encouraging independent problem-solving.

Features:
Supports multiple programming languages (Python, C, C++, Java)
Learns from user-defined dataset using Q-learning
Interactive command-line interface
Prints Q-table and mappings for transparency
